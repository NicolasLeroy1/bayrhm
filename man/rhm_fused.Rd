\value{
A list containing sampled values post burn-in for:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{lambda}}{Matrix of random effects coefficients for each group and each iteration.}
  \item{\code{mu}}{Global mean effects across iterations.}
  \item{\code{sigma2}}{Global variance across iterations.}
  \item{\code{tau2}}{Global control of random effects across iterations.}
  \item{\code{Omega2}}{Local control of consecutive differences across iterations.}
  \item{\code{W2}}{Local control of random effects across iterations.}

}
\description{
This function implements Gibbs sampling for Bayesian estimation of random effects
in regional heritability mapping. It uses group-fused Horseshoe techniques for regularization
of random effects coefficients. The function handles the random effects by utilizing singular
value decomposition components of given covariance matrices derived from genomic sub-blocks.
