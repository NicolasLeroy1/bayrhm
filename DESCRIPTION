Description: 
    This package provides three bayesian models implementation for genetic 
    cartography, the three models follow the Regional Heritability Mapping (RHM)
    framework, using linear mixed models to ajust random effets to genomic
    regions. The models differ by their regularization priors, the first use a
    horseshoe prior, the second a fusion-horseshoe to assume link between 
    adjacent regions and , and the third use a fused-horseshoe prior to mix 
    between the two precedent versions.
