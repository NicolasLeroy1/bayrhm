Description: 
    This package provides three bayesian models implementation for genetic 
    cartography, the three models follow the Regional Heritability Mapping (RHM)
    framework, using linear mixed models to ajust random effets to genomic
    regions. The models differ by the regularization priors applied to variance
    coefficients.
